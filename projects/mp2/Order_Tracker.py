    This tool is to track orders from the past 7 days and report some key statistics from those orders including how many orders came in, how much they were worth, where they went, what sold most, and which orders have not shipped yet. A tool that generates and summarizes this information can be used by companies to understand and improve their business performance. For example, they can use this tool to track their performance over time by comparing their weekly total number of orders/revenue, can

    ## 2. My Plan Before AI

    Before you ask your agent anything, open the API's address in your browser and read what comes back. Then write how you would solve it: the steps, in order, in plain words, in five lines or more. Then answer these:

    - Which functions will your tool need? For each, what goes in and what comes out?
    - Which addresses will they request?
    - How will you know you have every record?
    - Which check will you use in section 6, and which two numbers should agree?

    Commit with the message `mp2: plan before AI`.

    ## 6. How I Know These Numbers Are Right

    Reach at least one result a second way, in this notebook, and show that the two agree. Write a cell that gets the same number from other fields, or open the raw reply in your browser and find each number of one row of your table there. For instance: an average bill is close to the average value times the tax rate divided by 1,000; an order's total equals the sum of its lines; the number of records you collected equals the total the API reports.

    ## 7. Working With the Agent

    Pick one piece of AI output you did not accept as-is. What did it give you, what did you change, and how did you know? Point to the commit or the cell. If the agent got it right the first time: What did you do to verify that? Pointing to your check in section 6 is enough.

    ## 8. Reading It Back

    Pick two functions in your notebook that your agent wrote or helped write. For each, write in your own words what goes in, what comes out, and one line you had to ask about. Then choose one change to what the tool does, such as another county, another week or another rule. Changing one value in your Inputs cell is enough. Write what you expect to change in the answer. Commit with the message `mp2: prediction`, make the change, run it, and write what happened and whether it matched.
